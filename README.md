The Infinite West is an infinite runner game in which the player has to collect coins by jumping 
and avoiding different procedurally generated obstacles in order to beat their personal high score.

The car doesn't actually move in this game; two platforms constantly shuffle and move underneath the car to simulate infinite travel. The obstacles are randomly generated of 7 configurations.
